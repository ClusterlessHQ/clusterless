The command line:

====
cls [command] [<files>]

== Commands

global commands:

* `bootstrap` - initializes the cloud env for a given substrate, account, and region
* `show`  - show the available model types and print schemas
** `models`  - show the available model types and print schemas
** `substrates`  - show the available substrates

project scope commands:

* `substrates` - list all deployed substrates
* `regions` - list all deployed regions
* `arcs` - list all deployed arcs
* `boundarys` - list all deployed boundaries
* `verify` - confirm the project files will render
* `deploy` - renders then deploys the declared project configurations
* `diff` - renders then compares the local project configuration with deployed configuration
* `enable` - enable the listeners on the project, arc, or boundary
* `disable` - disable the listeners on the project, arc, or boundary
* `destroy` - destroys the project
* `status` - status of lot executions (for a time range) within a project, arc, or boundary
* `exec` - execute project arc(s) against give lots for testing, replay, or backfill
* `gaps` - show missing lots in a project, or given arc, and any missing upstream source arcs
* `rollback` - mark all completed lots for a given arc as replaceable so that any exec will overwrite them
* `dupes` - show or remove duplicate objects
* `local` - execute process locally

== Files

The `cls` client will process all given 'project' files.

Each file is a single or array of `project` deployments, where a deployment has a single target and declaration.

A target is the substrate, account id, and region, where applicable.

The declaration consists of the construct that will be managed as a single versioned project unit.

That is, if a project as a declaration for each of two regions (in AWS), us-west-1 and us-west-2, there will need to be two files, one for each region.

If identical region deployments are expected, each file should be identical, except where a declared resource could collide with a resource in another region (like an S3 bucket).

It is recommended all the project files have the same project name and version.
