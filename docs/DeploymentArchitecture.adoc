= Deployment Architecture

After a provider region is initialized via bootstrapping, a "project" can be deployed into the substrate.

A project is one or more related clusterless constructs.

Projects have:

- metadata
- provider
- region
- name
- version
- constructs
- resources
- arcs

`resources` can be S3 buckets or Glue Databases.

`arcs` listen for events about new data arriving for a given dataset, run a developer workload on the data, and then fire a new event for the change in the result dataset.

`datasets` typically live in blob storage (S3).
Data continuously arrives and is stored in a new partition in the bucket.
Listeners are then notified a new partition has arrived.
